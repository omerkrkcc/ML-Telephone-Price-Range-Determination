<h2>Stages :</h2>

<br> 1. Data Preprocessing
<br> 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
<br> 3. Decision Tree
<br> 4. Gradient Boosting
<br> 5. Random Forest
<br> 6. SVM
<br> 7. Classification metrics and Complexity Matrix of SVM, the most successful model, plotted with Heatmap function
<br> 8. Graphical representation of the best classification performance for each model
<br> 9. Determining the price scale according to the amount of ram
<br> 10.Impact of Processor Core Count and RAM on the price scale

<h2>Business Problem</h2> 

<br>Determine the price levels at which the phones with specifications can be sold
<br>Can you predict correctly with a machine learning model?

<br>consists of 2000 observations and 20 numerical independent variables. Target variable
<br>"price_range" is specified ;

<br>0 : Cheap</br>
<br>1 : Medium</br>
<br>2 : Expensive</br>
<br>3 : Too Expensive</br>


<br>Variables</br>
<br>- battery_power = Total energy a battery can store ( mAh )</br>
<br>- blue = Is Bluetooth present or not? 1: Present, 0: Absent</br>
<br>- clock_speed = Microprocessor speed</br>
<br>- dual_sim = Does it support dual sim cards ? 1: Supports, 0: Does not support</br>
<br>- fc = Front camera mega pixel</br>
<br>- four_g = 4G or not ? 1: Yes, 0: No</br>
<br>- int_memory = External Memory ( GB )</br>
<br>- m_dep = Telephone Depth ( CM )</br>
<br>- mobile_wt = Phone Weight</br>
<br>- n_cores = Number of Cores</br>
<br>- pc = Mega pixel of the first camera</br>
<br> - px_height = Pixel Resolution Height</br>
<br> - px_width = Pixel Resolution Width</br>
<br> - ram = RAM ( MB )</br>
<br> - sc_h = Screen height of the mobile phone in cm</br>
<br> - sc_w = Mobile phone screen width in cm</br>
<br> - talk_time = Longest time a single battery charge will last</br>
<br> - three_g = 3G or not ? 1: Yes, 0: No</br>
<br> - touch_screen = Is the screen touchscreen or not | 1: Touchscreen, 0: Not</br>
<br> - wifi = Wifi is available or not | 1: Available, 0: Not available</br>
<br> - price_range = Target variable.  3: Very Expensive, 2: Expensive, 1: Medium, 0: Cheap</br>
